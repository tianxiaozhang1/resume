# Summary

Former photographer with nine years of experience in working with a team in a fast-paced environment seeking to launch a career in programming. As a self-taught programmer, I am able to create fully-functional games and applications that can think on their own. An education in science combined with an artistic background give me a unique sense of design while maintaining rigorous logic.
